# ATM-Simulator
The ATM Machine Simulator is a Python program that mimics the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to interact with simulated banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and exiting the ATM session. The simulator is designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand.
